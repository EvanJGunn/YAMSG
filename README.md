# YAMSG
Yet Another Minecraft Smoke Generator

# Base Packages
A golang library that will have some vector math, and other stuff geared towards
converting / creating minecraft animations with command blocks.

# CLI
Uses the library in a CLI format.


# Server
Provides the library as a backend, potentially for website or plugin usage.


# Implementation Details To Remember
Minecraft has a 32k character limit on command blocks I believe - will need to keep this limitation in mind for the generator...
