Ok so after a little research it looks like dust is the minecraft particle that you can change the color of... and properly set and everything
+ after a little research this is exactly the kind of particle the guy was using from the video

/particle minecraft:dust 1.0 0.5 0.5 1.0 ~ ~1 ~ 0 0 0 0 1 force

1.0 0.5 0.5 -> color rgb
1.0 -> size
~ ~1 ~ -> position
0 0 0 -> direction vector ... or box within which it can spawn? maybe should be 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001
0     -> speed
1     -> count
force -> max 512 block view distance

old stuff

/particle minecraft:electric_spark ~ ~1 ~ 0.001 0.001 0.001 0 1 force

~ ~1 ~ -> position
0.001 0.001 0.001 -> box that the particle can spawn within, 0.001 makes it essentially always the same spot
0 -> speed, seems like this affects duration, as well as if it moves, 0 appears to make it stay still
1 -> count, affects how many spawn
force -> makes the particles appear at the max distance of 512 blocks


....

But for other particle effects the it turns into color and saturation... fubar




.... list

ambient_entity_effect - useless for my case, will move no matter what speed
angry_villager        - useless
ash                   - useless
block                 - fubar
block_marker          - fubar
bubble                - cant change color (I think), size varies
crit                  - useless for what I want, maybe useful elsewhere
